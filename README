This is a list of small programs that I wrote that are not worth dedicated
repositories.

- atm: command line interface to giromilano.atm.it.
- cbuild*: manage containers using overlayfs.
- withings/: download and graph the temperature data logged by a
  Withings Smart Body Analyzer.

Pull requests are welcome, but they will be rejected if they do not
solve a problem that I actually have.

Please do not ask for documentation.

If you break them then you get to keep both pieces.
